Naked and broken down
No one to save me now
You are You are You always will
All of my nerves exposed
And everybody knows
You are You are You always will
Your heart on me insatiable
The way you touch untouchable
Your arm unwrapping all around
In The Shade Of Light
In The Shade Of Light
In The Shade Of Light
You see me fall apart
Hand out to catch my heart
You are You are You always will
Your heart on me insatiable
The way you touch untouchable
Your arm unwrapping all around
In The Shade Of Light
In The Shade Of Light
In The Shade Of Light
